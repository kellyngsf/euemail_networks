# Networks

The purpose of this project is to learn how to plot networks. More importantly, learning how to deal with large networks which may be problematic for network visualisation. In this project, I will use a data set from the paper 'Local Higher-order Graph Clustering', Yin et al. (2017), which is an anonymised email data set from a large European research institution. The data set contains directed edges in the network when one person sents at least one email to another. Furthermore, the emails only represent communication within the institution. The network plot produced resulted in a plot that was unreadable and one that you could not get any information from, therefore, I condensed the data into a more informative plot using a dendrogram.
